# NextJs Starter

This is my personal NextJs starter template. It includes the following:

* Typescript
* TailwindCSS
* ShadcnUI Components
* ESLint
* Drizzle ORM
* AuthJs (Github OAuth)

## Getting Started

First, setup the environment variables. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.

Then, run:

```bash
bun dev
```
